# All About Tofu
 
my paen to one of the great loves of my life, tofu

## Some background

For as long as I can remember, I have always loved tofu. Yes, I love chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, fish, passionately too, but tofu was different. Was it because I grew up in Singapore, then Malaysia, then Myanmar and Indonesia that I love tofu the way I do? Perhapsâ€”it certainly explains why my tofu obsession skews less **East Asian** and more Southeast Asian, in a way.
